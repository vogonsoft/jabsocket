XMPP-over-WebSocket connection manager

Introduction
------------

jabsocket is an XMPP over WebSocket connection manager written in C. This means
that it is a server application that enables connection between a web
browser and an XMPP server.

The connection with JavaScript code running in a browser is over WebSocket.
jabsocket aims to support Websocket as defined in RFC-6455 and XMPP sub-protocol
for WebSocket as defined in the draft document
[An XMPP Sub-protocol for WebSocket](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-moffitt-xmpp-over-websocket-03)

NOTE: At this point, jabsocket is in alpha stage. Please see TODO for areas that
need work.
